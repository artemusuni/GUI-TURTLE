# GUI-TURTLE
Basic GUI interface for turtle(python)
This GUI allows you to draw shapes and letters of your choice.
At this moment there are only basic shapes like: circle, triangle, square.
You can also create your own shape by submitting the number of sides, side length and fillcolor!
Currently the button for drawing letters doesn't correctly word, thank you for understanding.
Future plan is to fix the problem with the letters and change the function that draws only letters to be able to draw words...
HAVE FUN!
